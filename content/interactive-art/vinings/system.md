Vinings develops Unfoldings further by making the physical interface and the music content mobile, wireless, modular and expandable. Therefore the Vinings installation is adjusted and developed further for each exhibition site. Vinings has a custom built sensor network for 9 modules. Vinings is programmed in [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io) with graphics in [Jitter/Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com). Vinings receive signals through tactile sensors in the spring coil wires, accelerometers in the and microphones in the tail.

The system outputs music and light in one channel per module.
