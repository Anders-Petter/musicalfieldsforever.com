Orfi is based on [Mufi](/interactive-art/mufi) and [Do-Be-DJ](/interactive-art/do-be-dj). But compared with them Orfi has new wireless modules, which changes the concept and interaction fundamentally.

The name "Orfi" comes from "Or" for origami and "fi" for "field". But Orfi also refers to Orpheus, the father of music in Greek mythology. He who according to the myth could make rocks dance. It is almost like Orfi...

The Orfi modules or cushions if you like communicate wireless with each other. So you can freely build, throw, play in and with the modules as you like. Orfi responds in changeable graphics, light and music, when you bend the wings of the modules.

### Create music in Orfi

Musically Orfi is original with several new genres. Some genres are based on sound files that change depending on your interaction. Other genres are made from program code that are being executed and altered during interaction. A new genre we call Voxx, is based on the co-creators/visitors live sound recordings via microphones. The recording is manipulated, re-arranged and organised dynamically between the cushions. Other new genres based on dynamically changing program code are Mini with minimalistic music and Glitch with noise music. Two new genres exploring traditional melodic music and film music are Arvo based on Arvo Paerts "Alina" and Tati based on the soundscape of Jaques Tati's film "Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot".
