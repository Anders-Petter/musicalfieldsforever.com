Orfi develops Mufi further by making the physical interface and the music content wireless, modular and expandable. Therefore the Orfi installation is adjusted and developed further for each exhibition site.

Orfi is based on the Mufi software and music and is developed in [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io), [Jitter/Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com) (graphics). The Orfi hardware is adjusted for wireless communication in a custom built sensor network.
