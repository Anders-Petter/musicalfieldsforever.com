The Polly World consists of four Co-creative Tangibles and two APPs. One APP, Polly Compose, is for interacting with the Co-Creative Tangibles at home, using a Smartphone or a Tablet over the Internet. The other APP, Polly Control is for setting up and manage the whole Polly World. All wireless and mobile Polly Tangibles have USB and Inductive battery charging. They also have separate on/off-functionality, so that they can run stand alone or together in the Polly World. All the Polly Tangibles have a unique sound system and speakers to provide high quality multi-channel sound. Polly has a specially developed lighting textile with embedded LED-light system and diverse sensorial stimulating surfaces to give the users unique sensorial, visual and tangible experiences.

The four Co-creative Tangibles are: Polly Land, Polly Planet, Polly Fire and Polly Ocean.
