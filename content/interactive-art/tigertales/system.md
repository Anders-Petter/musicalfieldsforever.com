TigerTales consists of three Tiger tails hanging from a roof or under a flight of stairs as in the lobby in HÃ¤ssleholm. Each tail is made of black velvet, gold textiles, brass pipes, large lightbulbs and many light leds on a string through the whole tail. A camera reads movements. The system analyse the input data and use it to edit the projected dynamic graphics and to filter, destroying and making variations to the background sound track.

The software is written in [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io), [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com) and [SoftVNS](http://homepage.mac.com/davidrokeby/softVNS.html).
