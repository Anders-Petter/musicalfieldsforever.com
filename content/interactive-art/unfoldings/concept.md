Unfoldings explores the ambiguity of our personal ways of expression. To physically express - to press out or unfold. To make our mark on life through our personal expression and to let life make its mark on us.

Unfoldings is an interactive audio-tactile field, open to potential movements that are reciprocated with music, moving images and light. Unfoldings is like a piece of furniture, a cross between cushion, armchair and travelling rug, to sit or lie on or use as a shawl or blanket. The individual interacts with the field by sitting down, moving or speaking - to one self or to others - to create one's own or together with others.

Unfold

...to unfold yourselves and unfold your environment as a dynamic creative process. Unfold your body. Unfold your environment. Unfold and express yourselves in sound, in music, in light...

Unfoldings

...to continiously unfold yourselves and your environment. ...to wonder, experience, share and remember...

Wonder what something really is...

Wonder what Unfoldings is. Something pulsating in light and sound. Is it alive? Is it a plant or an animal? Is it listening to what you are doing? Does it try to tell you something? Does it want something from you?

#### Experience
