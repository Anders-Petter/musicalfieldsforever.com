Wave Carpet is a 7-branched carpet. It is connected to an external computer and the power net, and therefore includes many input and output devices and offers many new cross-media interaction possibilities. Further it opens up for many future expansion possibilities. The software is developed in [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io), with dynamic graphics in [Processing](https://processing.org).
