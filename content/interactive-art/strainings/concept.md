To see is to choose. To see is to select something and overlook something else. To be seen is to exist. When someone set sights on you, you appear in the other persons world.

Strainings is about this genesis: to select what you want to keep from that which should be left out. In a physical, personal and cultural sense.

Strainings is an interactive sound and light (audiovisual) installation contained in a silo. The many interpretations of the word "strain" embrace all of this: to sift and to sort, as well as to stretch and pull a string. In Strainings the audience decides what should be heard and seen.

By pulling strings, they change the mesh of the strainer/ the large web. Light, sounds and images are strained and created.
