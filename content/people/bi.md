Birgitta Cappelen is an industrial designer (SID), interaction designer and associate professor at Oslo school of Architecture and Design (AHO). She is also working on her PhD at Malm√∂ University (K3). The working title of her PhD project is "Co-create and Re-create - rethinking Industrial Design in the digital age." In her work she tries to answer the question of what meaningful design can be in our time after postmodernism and with the computer as a material requirement. Instead of designing beautiful and user-friendly objects, she suggests designing fields of possibilities with a high degree of inscription and potential of circulation. She calls this design quality "multivalence".
